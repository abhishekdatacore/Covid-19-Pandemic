# Covid 19 Impact Analysis  
• The "Covid-19 Impact Analysis" project uses Python's Dash  
library and Flask for web deployment to create an interactive 
dashboard. 
• This dashboard visually represents key Covid-19 metrics such as 
total cases, active cases, recovered cases, and total deaths 
according to different states of India.  
 • It also analyzes the availability of essential items like masks, 
sanitizers, and oxygen. The goal is to make complex pandemic 
data easy to understand through interactive visuals. 

## Data Collection 
• I gathered a curated dataset from a CSV file, encompassing 
comprehensive information on Covid-19 cases. 
## Libraries Used  
• numpy and pandas for data manipulation and analysis. 
• plotly.graph_objs and plotly.express for creating interactive 
plots. 
• dash for web application development. 
• dash_core_components, dash_html_components for creating the 
layout components. 
• Input, Output from dash.dependencies for handling callbacks. 

 ### Screenshot Of this Project is attached in Repositories

## Challenges Faced and Solutions 
• Challenge: Implementing dynamic updates for graphs based on 
user interactions required careful handling of callbacks and data 
dependencies. 
• Dash's callback functionality was used effectively. 

## Conclusion  
This project not only enhances my skills in data analysis and web 
development but also serves as a practical application of data 
analytics and science in addressing real-world challenges.
